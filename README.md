Linear Preferential Attachment models are frequently used to theoretically explain why scale-free networks exist, but likelihood-based approaches are seldom done to test how well model explains data; fitted such a model using a novel likelihood-based method developed in the literature on a bit-coin network in R and devised a set of informal simulation studies to examine how well model matches up with data; developed the code from bottom-up.
